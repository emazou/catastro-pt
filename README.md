This is a Next.js frontend application, bootstrapped with create-next-app, leveraging Hasura with GraphQL and PostgreSQL for query handling.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository into your desired directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emazou/catastro-pt.git

```
Set up your .env.local environment variables as shown in .env.example:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL_API= #URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_SECRET= #Llave secreta

```

After cloning the repository to your local machine and configuring the environment variables, start the development server:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
# o
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application in action.
